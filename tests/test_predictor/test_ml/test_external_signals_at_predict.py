"""Regression tests for the predict-time external-signal pipeline.

History (2026-05-02): build_race_frame had been calling extract_features
without passing race_entry_id / race_id_for_signals, so every external-
signal feature (track_conditions, tipster_consensus, late_agf_drift,
workout_*, etc.) silently fell to NaN at inference even when the data
was in external_signals. The training path was correct, so the model
trained with the columns populated and predicted with them all null —
a persistent train/predict divergence.

These tests guard against that asymmetry creeping back in.
