"""Integrity smoke tests: guarantee predictions don't leak race outcomes.

Leakage would be a silent bug where the model's inference-time inputs
include a field only knowable *after* the race ran (finish_position,
finish_time, race-specific payout).  The entire +ROI claim collapses
if predictions have ever seen result data for the target race.

Two complementary tests:
  1. Static check of FEATURE_COLUMNS against a post-race blacklist.
  2. Dynamic invariance check: clearing the target race's finish data
     must leave predictions bit-for-bit unchanged.

Written after the 2026-04-23 session where the user asked "is it maybe
predicting after seeing winning horses?"  No leakage was found, but
these tests institutionalise the check.
