"""Workout-derived features from the ``tjk_workouts`` external_signals
plugin.

Each ``ExternalSignal`` row with ``source_name='tjk_workouts'`` is one
timed split (200m / 400m / 600m / 800m / 1000m / 1200m / 1400m).  Bound
to a ``race_entry_id`` by the resolver (matched by horse name on the
target race date).

We summarise a horse's recent workout activity into a single per-entry
"workout score" (lower seconds-per-meter = faster training pace) so it
can be fed as a within-race z-score offset to the Bayes PL model — same
shape as the Beyer speed feature.

Coverage is the binding constraint as of 2026-04-30: tjk_workouts only
started ingesting 2026-04-26.  Until ingestion accumulates enough
training-window overlap, ``delta_workouts`` will train at ≈0 and this
feature contributes nothing.  See `project_bayes_predictor.md`.
