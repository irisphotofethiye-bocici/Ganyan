"""Hand-tuned log-linear ranker (named "Bayesian" for legacy reasons).

Despite the module name, this is not Bayesian inference: there are no
priors fit on w, no posterior samples, no credible intervals.  The
prior ``1/n`` is uniform across entries in a race so it factors out of
the normalisation; what remains is::

    p_i = softmax_i(Σ_k FEATURE_WEIGHTS[k] · impact_k(horse_i))

i.e. a hand-tuned multinomial logit over the field.  It is documented
here so downstream code (Kelly sizing, calibration) doesn't
misinterpret the raw output as a calibrated win probability — it is
not calibrated without an explicit calibration layer.  See
:mod:`ganyan.predictor.ml.predictor` + temperature scaling and
:func:`ganyan.predictor.kelly.strategy_edge_stats` for the empirical
calibration that actually feeds sizing.

# v4 (2026-04): post-hoc factor audit on 7073 graded bayesian-v3 rows
# showed three features — ``form``, ``speed``, ``rest`` — were effectively
# constant (>85% of entries sat at the default value) and had |Pearson|
# correlation with winning of <0.03.  They were consuming 0.31 of the
# total likelihood budget as pure noise.  v4 zero-weights them and
# redistributes their budget to the three features that carry real
# signal: AGF (|r|=0.35), class (|r|=0.18), jockey (|r|=0.12).
#
# v5 (2026-04, post-rescrape): after backfilling EID/last_six/KGS/s20
# across 2026-01-22 → 2026-04-18, a re-audit on 13,300 finishers
# confirmed form/speed/rest are still weak — |r|<0.03 once AGF is
# partialled out — but surfaced ``s20`` (TJK last-20-races score) as a
# previously-unused signal with |r|=0.13 overall and 0.075 independent
# of AGF.  v5 adds ``s20`` at weight 0.10, funded from AGF (-0.05) and
# class/jockey (-0.05 combined).  Zero-weighted factors from v4 remain
# zero-weighted.
#
# v6-pending (2026-04-24): ``parse_last_six`` was silently broken —
# split-on-whitespace returned [None] for the production digit-packed
# format ("212464" etc.) so ``compute_form_cycle`` was always None for
# every row the v4/v5 audits saw.  After fixing the parser, 100% of
# rows now produce a real form value.  The v4/v5 "form has no signal"
# conclusion was measuring a constant-None feature, not an actually
# computed one — TODO: re-audit correlations with the fixed parser
# before keeping ``form``/``rest`` at zero.
