"""Strategy-level bet ledger: generate picks and grade them later.

Per race we record four Picks, one per strategy in :data:`STRATEGIES`.
This ledger is audit-of-record and stays continuous across advice-list
changes (e.g., a strategy that's been retired from the advice gate
keeps writing rows here for ROI tracking).

Live ledger ROI on graded picks since 2025-01-01 (as of 2026-05-02):

  - ``ganyan_top1``       1857 picks, 37.6% top-1 hit, ROI −19.9%
  - ``uclu_top1``          854 picks,  3.9% hit,        ROI −32.7%
  - ``uclu_box6``          854 picks, 13.6% hit,        ROI −5.3%
  - ``sirali_ikili_top1`` 1857 picks, 12.4% hit,        ROI −12.5%

The advice gate (CLI ``ganyan advice`` + web ``/advice``) advises a
subset — see ``BETTING_STRATEGIES`` in ``cli/main.py:2031`` and
``web/routes.py:1279``. Currently advice = ``("uclu_box6",
"sirali_ikili_top1")``; ``uclu_top1`` was retired 2026-05-02 (gated
ROI −100% on n=16). See ``feedback_advice_excludes_uclu_top1.md``.

``generate_picks_for_race()`` computes picks from the current model's
predicted probabilities and inserts a :class:`~ganyan.db.models.Pick`
row each. Idempotent — the ``(race_id, strategy)`` unique constraint
prevents duplicates; re-running with ``refresh=True`` rewrites
ungraded rows.

``grade_race()`` fills in ``hit``, ``payout_tl``, ``net_tl`` using
the scraped finish positions and TJK payouts once the race resolves.
