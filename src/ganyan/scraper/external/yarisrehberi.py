"""yarisrehberi.com tipster-picks scraper.

The site's homepage contains a public "Yapılan At Yarışı Tahminleri"
section listing user-submitted altılı (6-race parlay) tickets.  Each
ticket carries:

- A free-text title (e.g. ``"Ankara 2 Altılı"``) — sometimes specifies
  the track, often does not.
- A timestamp.
- 6 sub-races labeled ``"1. Koşu"`` through ``"6. Koşu"``, each with
  one or more horse-number picks (the gate / program-NO of the
  picked horse, *not* the horse name).
- ``Misli`` (multiplier) and ``Kupon`` (coupon size) metadata.

We persist each (sub_race, horse_number) pair as one signal row.
Resolving sub-race index → TJK race_id is handled lazily: at feature-
extraction time we look up which 6 races composed the altılı bundle
on that date; the binding lives outside this scraper because TJK
publishes it elsewhere (or it has to be derived from the program).

**Limitation observed during framework design (2026-04-26):** the
homepage's "Güncel" tab serves stale picks (Feb 2026) on most days.
Fresh picks sit behind the paid subscription paywall.  This scraper
captures whatever the homepage exposes; the freshness gap is a known
data-quality caveat tracked in the feature pipeline.
