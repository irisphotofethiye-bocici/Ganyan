"""Bind raw external signals to concrete TJK race / race_entry rows.

Plugins (e.g. ``yarisrehberi``) capture signals in a source-native
format — a tipster's altılı parlay carries ``(sub_race_index 1-6,
horse_number)`` but no TJK race_id.  This module performs the
resolution pass after ingestion: it figures out which 6 TJK races the
altılı bundle covered on that date, joins ``horse_number`` to
``race_entries.gate_number`` to get a concrete row, and back-fills the
``race_id`` / ``race_entry_id`` columns on the original signal.

Heuristic for the altılı-bundle discovery (TJK doesn't publish it
through a clean endpoint):

1. **Title-tagged tickets**: ``"Ankara 2 Altılı"`` → restrict to the
   Ankara card on that date.  ``"İstanbul Altılı"`` → İstanbul.  We
   do prefix matching against known track names.
2. **Untagged tickets**: applied to every track that has ≥6 races on
   the date (so a single ticket may produce multiple resolutions, one
   per track).  Cheap rows; the model can deduplicate via
   ``COUNT(DISTINCT ticket_timestamp)`` at feature time.
3. **Sub-race → TJK race_number**: altılı is by convention the *last
   6* races of the day on the chosen track.  Sub-race 1 maps to
   ``race[-6]`` (chronologically), 6 to ``race[-1]``.

Same-tipster duplicates are not deduplicated at the signal level —
each pick is one row — but the feature aggregator groups by
``ticket_timestamp`` so each ticket counts once per horse.
